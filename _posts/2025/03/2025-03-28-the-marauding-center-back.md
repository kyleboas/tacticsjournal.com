The most powerful addition to an attack has to be a marauding center-back. A player who shows up in places that the opposition would not suspect. You will be able take the penalty box by force.

Every player is marked one-v-one. What is the ultimate plus one? A center-back that is not afraid to get forward. One that is encouraged to get forward.

Why does the center-back have to be limited to the back line when, with coordination, the center-back can be used in attack?

No one sees it coming.

If I had to pick one player to play this role, it would be Declan Rice. 

A player that is defensively sound and good at winning duels because a maurading center-back will be caught higher up the pitch frequently. A player who is not afraid to make runs through the channels, through the half-spaces, towards the front line. Someone who is tall and fast, a mismatch for the fullbacks that will attempt to follow them. Most importantly, a player that is good at shooting and who will overpower the opposition's defenders when the ball is crossed into the box. 

Everyone is marked one-v-one, and then they go, they go, and one defender has to dismark from their attacker to follow the center-back getting forward.

As long as there is coordination, it will work. And when it works, the center-back is either going to draw a defender away from a forward, they won't be marked, or the opposition's forward will mark them. 

It is an even bigger mismatch if the opposition's forward tracks back with the center-back because they usually like to switch off in defense. That is an immediate plus one in attack because they won't track back with the attacking center-back with the same amount of intensity or urgency.

In moderation, because you want to maintain that level of surprise; in the hyperpositional world of football, a tall, fast, coordinated, marauding center-back who is good at dribbling can become a missile. 

It is hard to counter-press aggressively in your own end when that constant threat is there lurking.
