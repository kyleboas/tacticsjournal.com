For the past 25 years, every Premier League champion had a talisman. It is unlikely you will finish first if you don't have that one player to propel you to the top of the table. This could be the first year it is a defender — Gabriel for Arsenal.

The talisman does not have to be the top scorer. You see their name and picture their team lifting the trophy. They are the face of that team's season.

They are the kind of player whose absence makes you sigh and think, "This is going to be a long day." They are the one you’d feel nervous not seeing walk out of the tunnel with the rest of the starters.

Arsenal have enough depth. Their B team could challenge for a Premier League title. But when you picture a goal from a set piece, you see Gabriel.

A team without a talisman isn’t competing for the title — it’s waiting for next season to begin.
