I stopped focusing on analyzing individual games or moments within games to share original ideas based on real events. Timeless pieces of information and ideas that you could apply to any situation, past or present.

The inventor of Super Glue, Harvey Coover, didn't call it Super Glue when it was created. He first named it [Eastman 910 adhesive](https://youtu.be/Ni82f1-cAXg?si=WnvTlLoPp_T5y-sf) because it was the nine-hundredth test in the company's search. A one-off brand that will be iterated upon by one company, rather than the iconic Super Glue name used by everyone.

That is what it feels like to write about a match or a play. That thing you pointed out gets branded to that match, that specific date, while a broader idea that could become timeless gets lost. That one-off idea expires the day you point it out because the noise of the match distracts those that are reading.

Super Glue is timeless. Sharing something that is timeless or unforgettable seems more interesting. Talking about [distracted strikers](https://tacticsjournal.com/2025/01/12/the-distracted-striker/) in general is timeless; talking specifically about Kai Havertz and Darwin Núñez would have been a one-off.

And there's less pressure to get it out now because the event happened yesterday, and it needs to stay relevant in the mind to make sense. If it is timeless, you could wait a month, and it will still matter.

You are never going to remember Eastman 910 adhesive but you will remember Super Glue.
