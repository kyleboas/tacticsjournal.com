I am of the belief that many of the greats are above average, but the thing that makes them a great is their mentality. Winners can do it better than you because they have the confidence to declare they will win.

<!---more--->

Winners must set a deadline on when they will complete their goal. You can't cower behind a promise of the future when you set a deadline. You win, and then you promise more.

A loser's mentality is as contagious as a winner's mentality. That is a major problem for someone who doesn't set a deadline.

If winners offer an excuse for why they didn't achieve their goal, they do it when they are leaving, not when they are still on the job. You either stay or you go; you don't stick around.

Winners are always memorable. You remember a loser for the sum of their work. You remember winners for their moments. You remember a loser's moments because it reminds you of the promises they made. 

You will not be able to turn down an average product sold by someone who has the mentality that it will change your life. It is going to change your life now, or it won't.
