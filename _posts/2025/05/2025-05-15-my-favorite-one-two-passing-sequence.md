This is the most satisfying one-two passing sequence. Line-breaking pass through the middle, one-touch pass to the close second center-forward, peel away from the pass, one-touch through ball back to the center-forward, and you are in on goal.

The pass to the right center-forward needs to be led ahead and to the left of the right center-forward to force the trailing center-back to move to the inside.

Then the right center-forward plays the pass on their first touch to the left-center forward. The right center-forward immediately peels off to the left towards the goal.

Having the left center-back cheat to the inside, leading them infield, is important because it creates that necessary separation for the final through pass.

The pass from the right center-forward to the left center-forward needs to be played behind the right center-forward so that they can play the following through ball with their right foot. Otherwise, they would have to play that pass with the outside of their foot and will generate less power on the pass. Or worse, they'd have to take a second touch.

If the right center-forward takes a touch, this play doesn't work because the right center-forward will be offside by the time the through ball is played.

If the pass is well timed, on the left center-forward's first touch, it is an easy chance if the right center-forward has the pace to outrun the two center-backs.

One of the biggest challenges is that systems with two center forwards are uncommon, making this type of passing sequence rareâ€”but it is always satisfying to watch.

If the right center-forward doesn't get enough separation in on goal, the left center-forward or another attacker should be open for a cut-back across goal for the tap-in because both center-backs will be drawn towards the main threat, the through ball.

The left center-forward doesn't even necessarily have to be physically strong, because they should have enough space to get off that through ball on their first touch.

The major perquisite is that the center-forward being played through has to have sufficient pace, or an additional pass will be required after the through ball.
