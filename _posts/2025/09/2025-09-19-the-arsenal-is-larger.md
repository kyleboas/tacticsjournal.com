The Premier League, FA Cup, and Champions League will be won by the teams with the fewest points of failure. Arsenal are clear favorites because of their quality in depth, which will help them withstand the inevitable injuries every team faces.

In previous seasons, if William Saliba or Bukayo Saka were left out of the lineup for an extended period, Arsenal would fall apart. Their season would be considered "over." Not anymore.

If Saliba goes down, you have Masquera. If Masquera goes down, you have White. If White goes down, you have Timber. If Gabriel goes down, you have Hincapie. If Hincapie goes down, you have Calafiori. If Rice goes down, you have Merino. If Merino goes down, you have Nørgaard. If Ødegaard goes down, you have Nwaneri or Eze. If Havertz goes down, you have Gyokeres. If Gyokeres goes down, you have Trossard or Martinelli. If Eze goes down, you have Trossard or Martinelli. If Saka goes down, you have Madueke or Dowman. And so on. Plus, the majority of their players can play at least two positions.

When you can start Eze and Saka and then sub on Martinelli and Madueke, with Trossard and Dowman backing them up, that is a completely different level. That changes many things, including the game plan in each phase of a game and in each half. You can play at full intensity for the full 90 minutes without worrying about the next match.

No other Premier League club has this amount of quality in depth. Chelsea has an A and B team, but they don't come close to the caliber of players Arsenal has. Arsenal is a competent version of Chelsea's squad building. Injuries are not an excuse Arsenal can use if they don't win silverware this season.

Liverpool and Manchester City are worse defensively and better in attack, but if they face an injury crisis, they're done. It would be impressive if Arsenal could find a way to have an "injury crisis."

Arsenal already had the best defense and the best set pieces, and their attack is improving. Their floor is higher because of the depth, and they can attack the season with a heightened intensity.

The biggest critique you could give Mikel Arteta is that he doesn't rotate the lineup as much as he could. He shoots himself in the foot by not taking advantage of easily winnable fixtures. For example, they won 5-0, but why was there a need to go full strength against Leeds United at home seven days before playing Liverpool at Anfield? 

The league is not won in one game, no matter how important the game is. You can't be afraid to use your bench. All it takes is two or three changes per game to maintain the rhythm. Once the bench gets into rhythm with the best eleven, then the best eleven becomes a best fifteen or sixteen. You're never worried that this player is left out of the starting lineup, because their replacement is ready and has been given game time in the big games and the lesser games.

Mosquera and Madueke's performances since Saliba and Saka became injured should give Arteta confidence to use his bench. You can never fully predict or avoid an injury, but why not attempt to avoid the possibility of injury altogether by putting someone in that you can afford to lose? 

You put them in, they build confidence, and then, worst-case scenario, you have a benching headache. How do you bench Mosquera or Madueke with the form they are in?
