The best ideas are ones that are not forced. They will flow out of you. You won't even be able to give yourself a second to overthink it.

There are times when you want to force an idea, to make it work, but when you're finished you know it's rushed. That's a negative feeling.

Once you have a great idea, it doesn't feel like the next one will ever come, but it does. And when it does you can feel it.

There are games where I'm searching for an angle, searching for something to point out. 

Not every game or action is worth reacting to.

There are times where I think a change needs to be made within a game.

Sometimes patience is the best change.
