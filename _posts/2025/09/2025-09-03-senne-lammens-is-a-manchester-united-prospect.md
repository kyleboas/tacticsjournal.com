Manchester United's newest goalkeeper Senne Lammens is 6'4 and makes great reaction saves, but he has a skinnier build and a shorter reach due to the fact that gets his hands in the game but not his legs. That makes him look less imposing in net.

<!---more--->

The way in which he prepares the lower half of his body for the shot can make his arms look shorter than they are when he dives. He looks to get down quick rather than explode off his trailing leg. He may have trouble with high shots to his right or left because he favors protecting against shots below his waist. He prepares to defend against low shots and looks surprised with higher shots.

He likes to cut down the angle of the shot by positioning himself closer to the top of the six yard box. He is not afraid to come off his line at all times but if he has time to think he will sit in a more neutral stance. That is one of the reasons why he is good at cross claiming; he is an itchy-footed keeper. 

If the ball bobbles around in a crowded box he has trouble tracking the ball but if he faces a clean shot, his quick reflexes and positioning can bail him out on occasion.

He has strong hands and parries well when he faces clean shots, but with deflected shots his parrying is inconsistent and he will sometimes parry away from his intended direction which can lead to scrambles on the line.

He favors covering the near post and parrying shots from wider angles towards the penalty spot which can lead to easily converted tap-in goals from onrushing attackers.

The headline will be his raw stats. Amongst goalkeepers in the Belgian Pro League in 2024/25, [according to Sofascore](https://x.com/sofascoreint/status/1962525167231381606?s=46&t=EwWKBMyY400eGGXYwoRkiw), he had the most saves (173), the most saved shots from inside the box (114), most penalties saved (4), most high claims (48), and most goals prevented (15.57). 

There is a lot to be excited about for the future but Manchester United fans should temper expectations. I don't think he should start ahead of the more experienced Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir because he needs more time to improve and develop his consistency in parrying and general awareness. It would be unfair to throw a player of his experience into goal immediately.
