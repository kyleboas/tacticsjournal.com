Are the players tactically flexible or is the manager tactically flexible? It is the assumption that the manager is always in control that makes assigning blame or congratulations challenging. The manager is assumed to always be in control.

If we don't know what the script is, how do we know when the players go off script? Why do the players need a script, they are free-thinking professionals? 

The threat of less minutes is a big threat. I can understand why a player would be afraid to express themselves because if they are wrong, and sometimes even if they are right, they'll get less minutes if they deviate from the script, the plan.

I can agree the players need a script. They need a form of guidance, but the manager is not kicking the ball, they aren't in the challenges, they aren't spotting the spaces.

The headline should be, the players made a difference, they adapted to the manager's instructions, because we don't know who to applaud.

Applaud the team by default.
