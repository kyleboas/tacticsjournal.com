If you want to experience football fully, you need to watch teams at all levels, not only the high-level teams. You have to see the creative ways teams compromise.

<!---more--->

Every team has their strengths and weaknesses. If you combine one thing from one team and one thing from another and add in some depth, you have a winning team. But in isolation, that one team will have to compensate for their weaknesses. To compensate, they'll make sacrifices. 

You are missing out if you don't watch these lesser teams live because in order to perform above their means, they have to come up with unique ideas in attack or defense.

Isolate those individual ideas, apply them to a team playing at a higher level, and you will be able to solve unique problems. 

Find ways to benefit from the struggling teams. You'll appreciate the teams playing at the top level of football more.
