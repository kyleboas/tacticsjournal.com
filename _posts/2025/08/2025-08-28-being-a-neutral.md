You can like an aspect of a manager's game or a set of players, even when the result goes against them. You can look forward to watching a team even if you know they'll likely lose. That is the beauty of being a neutral.

Manchester United under Ruben Amorim this season with their quick one-touch passing; the chemistry between Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Bruno Fernandes makes me tune in. They are poor defensively, and their midfield has trouble completing passes at times, but I don't care. 

Wolverhampton Wanderers under Gary O'Neil with Matheus Cunha, Rayan Ait-Nouri, and Hwang Hee-Chan was fluid and electric. A team full of dribblers will never not be entertaining. They had lacked center-backs, they conceded loads of goals, but I don't care.

Bournemouth under Andoni Irola this season presses like no other team in the Premier League with such high intensity for the full match. A nightmare for teams that have the qualitative advantage because they love to chase, and force errors. They don't let you breathe but their forwards are frustrating to watch; they can't finish, but I don't care.

I don’t care about the outcome of the match. I’ll tune in regardless.

You can tell, if those managers had a better midfield duo, better defenders, or better forwards, they should succeed. They'd win.

If you can take one thing from each of them and apply it to another team to improve a weakness, it is worth it to watch. You can learn something, it can spark an idea.

Most importantly, you can appreciate the individual performances of the players while ignoring their frustrating teammates.
