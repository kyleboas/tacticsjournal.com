I miss connecting with those on X, formerly Twitter, but I don't miss participating on the platform.

<!---more--->

It has been six months since [I stopped posting on X](https://tacticsjournal.com/2025/01/01/why-the-tactics-journal-is-no-longer-posting-on-x/) and while it was not a pleasant place to visit every day, there are people whose company I enjoyed. Who I miss talking to.

I'm still learning. I miss learning from them, and the most impactful way of learning is by having a conversation. Not by occasionally lurking. By having a constant dialogue.

There are a ton of talented individuals out there. It is important to get different perspectives. The dialogue back and forth spurs on new ideas. Then you take on those ideas, adapt them into how you think, which improves your way of thinking.

Others spot things I can't see, things I may not be paying attention to. Some people hyperfocus on things I don't, like specific teams or a specific tactical philosophy. That is a massive asset.

To have your thoughts read by real-world professionals at the highest level is something that I never thought possible. That can only be made possible online, and it has been made possible for me.

Being able to share my thoughts online with others is not the reason why I watch football. If I stopped posting altogether, anywhere, or if I never started sharing my thoughts in the first place, I would still watch the same amount of football as I do now, as I did before. That would never change. 

Writing about football is my way of reaching out to like-minded people and sharing my ideas. I'll continue sharing those ideas here.
