I'm building a social platform called SyncdChat that eliminates spoilers for football fans. It syncs chat messages to your specific stream delay, ensuring everyone reacts to the goal together, no matter the lag. I need your help beta testing it.

This is an idea that I've had for a number of months that I put into motion the past few weeks. I would greatly appreciate it if you tried it.
