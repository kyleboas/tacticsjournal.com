I built a social platform for football fans called SyncdChat. It syncs chat messages to your specific stream delay, ensuring everyone reacts to the goal together, no matter your delay. I need your help beta testing it.

You know the feeling. You're watching the big game, the ball is on the wing, and suddenly—BZZT.

Your phone lights up. The group chat is going wild. You haven't seen the goal yet, but you know it happened. The moment is ruined.

Streaming lag is the enemy of live sports. So, I decided to fix it.

This is an idea that I've had for a number of months that I put into motion the past few weeks. 

If you are tired of muting your phone during matches, I want you to try this.
