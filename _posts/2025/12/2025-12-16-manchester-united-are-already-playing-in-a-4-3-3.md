When Manchester United have the ball, they are aligned on the diagonal in a 4-3-3. You wouldn’t call Amad Diallo a wing-back, you would say he is playing right wing. It is an attack that challenges the way we look at formations traditionally.

When you look at the team on the diagonal, Bruno Fernandes looks more like a roaming box-to-box midfielder. Closer to a number ten than a defensive midfielder. Mason Mount joins from the left in this makeshift asymmetrical midfield three. Casemiro anchors the midfield. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who have license to swap positions and drop back, offer a passing option to feet or will run beyond the opposition’s back-line in behind. Amad Diallo acts as the main outlet on the far side, the target for the switch of play.

You have to assign roles to these players instead of positions to fully appreciate what they are doing, what they are actually trying to achieve instead of what we want them to achieve.

As Ruben Amorim mentioned when his team was compared to Crystal Palace, a team that doesn’t organize on the diagonal, play with a back five, and use wingbacks:

> "We play in a different way. And you can understand that by data. But now it’s hard to explain everything. But you don’t say that all 4-3-3 [teams] play in the same way, right? We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we try to attack in a different way.” 

He sees United more as a team that plays in a 4-3-3. I sympathize with him because *Diagonality* is a hard thing to describe. If you aren't looking for this you will miss it. I don't blame you for missing it because it is a different way to look at a game. But when you see it you can't unsee it, and it is effective.

How do you press a team that has their defenders on one side of the pitch and forwards on the other? One switch of play and you are immediately caught with your pants down. You are exposed.

When Bukayo Saka tracks back for Arsenal, we don’t call him a wing-back, we call him a winger. The same applies here. 

Amad Diallo tracks back to mark the left-back in defense, and cover for the right-back when the back post is open. But he isn’t good at tracking the ball or his man. He’s not blazing fast in a straight line like Bryan Mbeumo is. He’s alright in the duels but he’s not a player you’d want to have in the back-line.

Manchester United’s best defensive performance this season came against Brighton. It was the first game that Amad Diallo stayed further forward to mark the opposition’s left-back, Maxim De Cuyper.

Bryan Mbeumo was the one to track back and mark the speedy Yankuba Minteh, to defend the space beyond the back line when United lost the ball. He was better at sweeping in transition because of his pace and he’s better at tracking the ball.

United align on the diagonal from left to right. When they lose the ball, their right side is more exposed in transition. Either Mbeumo or Amad have to track back and sweep. The strong left side presses and covers while the weak far side sweeps until they regain control.

They stopped having Mbeumo track back against Everton because of a change in personnel. One side is always offensive and one side is defensive. Mazraoui, the right-back, is defensive and Dorgu, the left-back, is offensive. Since then they’ve abandoned having Mbeumo track back and the defensive performances have become mixed.

Is their execution always good? No, but they started to become more consistent attacking wise. Does their defense have enough quality? No, they don’t have enough quality in the center-back position. Are they the most entertaining attacking team in the Premier League? For me, still no question, yes.

But all of this comes with a massive disclaimer. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo will be going on international duty to the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) for several weeks. A massive loss of epic proportions. I don't know how they'll play from today onwards without them. 

My guess is they'll use Patrick Dorgu as the outlet but on the left, instead of Amad Diallo on the right. The issue is that they've never tried that without Bryan Mbeumo on the pitch. Maybe they'll organize on the diagonal from right to left instead to try to compensate. I'm very interested to see what they have planned and how big of a mess it will be.
