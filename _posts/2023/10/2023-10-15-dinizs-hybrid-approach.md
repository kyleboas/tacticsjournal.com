Attempting to impose principles of relationism on eleven Brazilians who are accustomed to the European way of life is challenging, as manager Fernando Diniz is finding.

This is not like watching Fluminense. It's a hybrid approach, combining [relationism and positionism](https://medium.com/@stirlingj1982/what-is-relationism-c98d6233d9c2). Rome was not built in a day, and neither will Brasília.

Brazil often favored overloading the left-wing, leaving Danilo frequently open on the right side. Unfortunately, he struggles to exploit this space due to his lack of speed to beat Venezuela's left-back, Christian Makoun. If he attempts a cross, it's likely to be from deep, with a small chance of resulting in a high-quality opportunity, as he only has Richarlison to aim for.

Chances primarily arose from passes to the free man on the far side or long-range shots from beyond 18 yards.

I was looking forward to this international break to see Brazil and understand what's on Diniz's mind, providing insights into the talent on the field. However, I left disappointed because we didn't get to see them express themselves freely. The players seemed to be cautious, as if they were being watched by an imaginary coach who'd scold them to maintain their positions and zones.

I wish Diniz would encourage his team to break away from the European way of playing, even if only during international duty, so we could enjoy their flair and creativity. 

I believe that if players were assured they would be praised for moving freely, they would produce more attractive football and create more chances.
