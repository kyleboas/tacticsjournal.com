The Tactics Journal is a football tactics blog written by Kyle Boas, focused on analyzing football tactics.

I want to find and talk about the world's most interesting players, managers, and teams. I focus on European football, with a primary focus on the Premier League. Here is my reasoning for [why I talk about the Premier League](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/12/07/why-i-talk-about-the-premier-league/).

I want to explore everything there is to explore in football. What works, what doesn't, and what we should be paying attention to. I try to spot trends before they become popular.

I build my case [brick by brick](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/11/30/brick-by-brick/), like a lawyer. I may cover one small detail; my posts might be short, but each individual post builds up that massive wall of evidence to help prove a point or share a new idea.

I have no professional experience in football; I don't claim to be an expert, but I have many years of experience playing and watching football. Enough experience to be able to point out things that may not be obvious to others and to have an opinion.
